# About Docker
The docker engine consists of two parts: a daemon, a server process that manages all the containers and a client, 
which acts as a remote control for the daemon. You can think of containers as a process in a box. The box contains 
everything the process might need, so it has the filesystem, system libraries, shell and such, but by default non of 
these are running. You 'start' a container by running a process.

# Delete all containers

docker build -t peachstone/dev.

# Run process in a container:
docker run peachbox/dev echo 'Hello peachbox'

# Run interactive shell
docker run -i -t peachstone/dev/bin/bash

# Find ID of the container which is created after every change:
docker ps -l

# Commit your changes:
